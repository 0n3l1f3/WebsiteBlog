    <h2>INTRODUCION</h2>
    <img src="images/redDummyImage.png" alt="Dummy Image">
    <p>Hi, I'm YNDS, a  digital illustrator passionate about bringing ideas to life through art. My work explores is inspired by anime and manga and I am aiming to evoke emotion and spark imagination.</p>

  <div class="firstCommission">
    <h2>First Project: A Tribute to Zombie Man</h2>
    <img src="images/redDummyImage.png" alt="Dummy Image">
    <p>I've always been a huge fan of One Punch Man, captivated by its incredible art style and unforgettable characters. One character that stood out to me was Zombie Man—his design, resilience, and raw aesthetic felt perfect for my first major project.

      A key memory tied to this piece was sketching it in an airport while traveling to Nigeria. Amid the rush of travelers and airport announcements, I found myself lost in the details of the drawing, bringing Zombie Man to life on my sketchpad. That moment reinforced my love for creating art, no matter where I am.
      
      This project set the foundation for my artistic journey, blending my passion for anime with my own creative vision.</p>

    <h2>BEST COMMISSION</h2>
    <img src="images/redDummyImage.png" alt="Dummy Image">
    <p>One of the most exciting milestones in my journey was landing my first commission—creating cover art for the artist Logic. As a longtime fan of his music, the opportunity to collaborate with him was both surreal and an incredible honor. I poured everything into the project, making sure the artwork matched his vision while bringing my own creative touch to the piece.

      Working with Logic was not only a huge confidence boost but also a defining moment that showed me the power of art in connecting with people. It reinforced my passion for visual storytelling and pushed me to keep evolving as an artist.</p>

  <div class="latestCommission">
    <h2>LATEST COMMISSION</h2>
    <img src="images/redDummyImage.png" alt="Dummy Image">
    <p>This digital art commission for Central Cee’s album cover was an exciting project that allowed me to blend realism with abstract design. My goal was to capture the raw energy and presence of Central Cee, while also reflecting the innovative and fast-paced nature of his music. I focused on creating a sharp, detailed portrait of the rapper, emphasizing his confident expression and signature streetwear through intricate digital brushwork. For the background, I used glitchy textures and neon colors to evoke the modern, high-energy vibe of his sound. This piece not only showcases my technical skills in digital art but also demonstrates my ability to visually represent the essence of contemporary music culture. It was an honor to have it featured on his album, and it stands as one of my proudest works in my portfolio.</p>
